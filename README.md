# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Techniques

## Definitions
| Syntax      | Function  | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :-------|
| $RR$  |   | Recurring revenue (RR) without respect to the time period, which could be monthly or annually. Recurring revenue can include subscription payments and also any revenue generated by ads, in-app purchases, or use charges.       |
| $CAC$  |  | Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is the total amount spent on marketing and sales per customer acquired. CAC usually depends on the channel or campaign through which the customer was acquired.        |
| $COGS$  |  | Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the total amount spent to maintain the service for existing customers, including things like cloud computing costs and the cost of providing customer support. COGS can depend on the type of customer. |
| $CLV$  | $CLV = \sum_{\text{Lifetime}}(RR-COGS)-CAC$ | The name customer lifetime value implies that it combines all the costs and recurring revenue over the customerâ€™s expected lifetime. |
| $FLV$   | $FLV = \sum_{\text{Future}}(RR-COGS)$ | Future lifetime value (FLV) is the sum of the recurring payments and maintenance costs, at any time after the first period. |
| $FLV$   | $FLV = m\sum_{\text{Future}}(RR)$ | Future lifetime value (FLV) with margin instead of COGS|
|$FLV$|$FLV = mRR\frac{retention}{1+discount-retention}$|Discounted Version of FLV to account for the time value of money.|
| $NPV$  |  | TBD |
| $m$   |$m = \frac{RR-COGS}{RR}$|Margin | 
| $L$   | $L = \frac{1}{Churn}$| Lifetime is the average expected length of survival given a known churn rate.|




## NPV Calculation
Summary of Metrics used to calculate Final NPV
\
\
$$\text{NPV} = \frac{\text{Total Cashflow}}{(1-\text{Discount Factor} * (1-\text{Avg. Mthly Churn Over Quarter}))}-\text{Total SAC / CAC}$$

\
\
\
Notes:\
$\text{Total Cashflow} = \text{Total Mthly ARPU} - \text{Total Mthly Variable Costs}$


Discount factor = <br>
$\huge df_{t} = \frac{1}{(1 + r_{t})^{t}}$<br>
$df_{t}:\text{discount factor at time }t$<br>
$r_{t}:\text{interest or risk rate at time }t$<br>
